<h2>Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1st. The impossible</h3>
    <h4>Adventure/Drama<br />
    2012<br />
    1h 54m</h4>
    <p>Genuinely one of the most harrowing and heart breaking films I have ever watched. Based on the true events of a devastating
        tsunami that hit the coast of Thailand.</p>

<h3>2nd. Se7en</h3>
    <h4>Crime/Mystery<br />
    1995<br />
    2h 7m</h4>
    <p>Who doesn't love a good murder mysetery, this gruesome and twisted depiction of what the human mind is capabale of is
        probably what got me hooked on crime novels as a young adult.</p>
    
<h3>3rd. Hereditary</h3>
    <h4>Horror/Indie film<br />
    2018<br />
    2h 7m</h4>
    <p>Given that I am not a horror movie fan, to see this on my top 3 probably tells you just how good a film it is. 
        The geniuousness of the films cinematography creates the most eerie atmosphere you can image that will have you both 
        struggling to look away but wishing you could.</p>
